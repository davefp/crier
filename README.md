# DOWN

## What is it?

Down is an open-source server status service. Try saying that three times fast.

It allows you to quickly build a server status page that'll look a bit like this:

* [status.shopify.com]
* [status.github.com]
* [status.heroku.com]

## Features

* Support for multiple service modules with different statuses
* API for updating the status from your favourite monitoring tool(s)
* Admin dashboard
* Status history
* Custom messages detailing any issues
